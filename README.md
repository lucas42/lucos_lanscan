# lucos_lanscan
Looks at the local network and reports changes to loganne

## Deprecated
Have changed router, so it's unlikely this will work again, given it was screenscraping a web interface

## Implementation
Makes a call to the router's web interface every 5 seconds.  Compares lists to deduce which devices have been added or removed
